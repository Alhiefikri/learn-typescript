# **Learn TypeScript ðŸš€**  

This repository contains my learning journey in **TypeScript**, covering fundamentals, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), generics, and real-world projects.  

## ðŸ“Œ **Topics Covered**  
- âœ… TypeScript Basics (Types, Interfaces, Enums, etc.)  
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism)  
- âœ… Generics and Utility Types  
- âœ… TypeScript with React & Next.js (Coming Soon)  
- âœ… Small Projects and Exercises  

## ðŸ“‚ **Structure**  
```
/01_basics      â†’ TypeScript fundamentals  
/02_oop         â†’ Object-Oriented Programming  
/03_projects    â†’ Mini-projects using TypeScript  
```

## ðŸš€ **Why TypeScript?**  
TypeScript improves JavaScript with static typing, better tooling, and enhanced maintainability. It helps catch errors early and makes large-scale projects easier to manage.  

## ðŸ’¡ **How to Use**  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn-typescript.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:  
   ```bash
   cd learn-typescript
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if needed):  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run TypeScript files:  
   ```bash
   npx ts-node filename.ts
   ```

## ðŸ“œ **Notes**  
This repo will be updated regularly as I continue learning. Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or contribute! ðŸš€
